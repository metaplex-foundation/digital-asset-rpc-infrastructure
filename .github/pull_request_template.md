Thank you for taking the time to make an enhancement or bug fix to the digital asset validator rpc repo.
To ensure a quality PR experience this call may be recorded. Just Kidding, but we do expect a few things.

1. The Name of the PR will show up in the changelog so make it a good one, we will rename PRs or reject based on the name.
2. Please make the PR as small as possible to achieve the bugfix or feature. Big prs often are scary and hard to review.
3. Be kind to your reviewers 🤓
4. Add a good description, so we can see what the PR is all about without investing the time in the code review. We will often review code at a certain time in the day and having a list if important prs to review helps us move that along.
