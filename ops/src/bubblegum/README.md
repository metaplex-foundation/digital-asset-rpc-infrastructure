# Bubblegum

The bubblegum CLI assists in detecting and indexing missing updates for compression trees that are managed by the MPL bubblegum program.

## Commands

Command line arguments can also be set through environment variables.

### Backfill

The `backfill` command initiates the crawling and backfilling process. It requires the Solana RPC URL, the database URL.
